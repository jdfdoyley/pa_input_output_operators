 * Main application (program) class.
 * Write an application to demonstrate the use of input, output and operators.
 * The application must:
 * - Print a line that states "Your Name - Week 1 PA IO & Operators"
 * - Demonstrate integer-based operations
 *    - Retrieve 2 integer values from the user
 *    - Display the sum of those two values
 *    - Display the comparison results of value 1 to value 2, including:
 *      - Equality - whether the values are equal or not equal
 *      - Size - whether value 1 is greater than or less than value 2
 *      - Size with equality - whether value 1 is greater than or equal to or
 *        less than or equal to value 2
 * - Demonstrate floating point-based operations
 * - Retrieve 2 floating point values from the user
 * - Display floating point values to 4-decimal point precision
 * - Display the sum of those two values
 * - Display the comparison results of value 1 to value 2, including:
 *    - Equality - whether the values are equal or not equal
 *    - Size - whether value 1 is greater than or less than value 2
 *    - Size with equality - whether value 1 is greater than or equal to or
 *      less than or equal to value 2
